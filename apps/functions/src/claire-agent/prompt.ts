/**
 * prompt.ts — Claire persona + slang + delivery rules + per-process-state mode directives.
 *
 * Voice lives HERE (prompt + few-shot), NOT in post-gen string processors. This is the RC4
 * fix: no "scratch that," no imperfection-injector artifacts — the imperfection layer is gone.
 * The RC3 fix is the injected global context (canonical pa-users.tags): when asked what's
 * saved, the model reads THESE, not a stale store.
 *
 * Extends the proven POC INSTRUCTIONS with the triage/onboarding/prescreen mode directives
 * (AGENTIC-ARCHITECTURE §1) and the flexibility (interrupt+resume) rule.
